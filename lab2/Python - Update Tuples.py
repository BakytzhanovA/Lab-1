#Change Tuple Values
#Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.
#But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

#Convert the tuple into a list to be able to change it:

x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)

#Example
#Convert the tuple into a list, add "orange", and convert it back into a tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.append("orange")
thistuple = tuple(y)

#Create a new tuple with the value "orange", and add that tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = ("orange",)
thistuple += y

print(thistuple)

#Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can use the same workaround as we used for changing and adding tuple items:
#Convert the tuple into a list, remove "apple", and convert it back into a tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.remove("apple")
thistuple = tuple(y)
